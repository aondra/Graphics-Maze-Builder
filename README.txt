Overview:
This program uses an implementation of the Kruskal Algorithm in order to randomly generate mazes of different sizes.  A typical implementation of this algorithm involves the use of Disjoint Sets.  In order to better understand Disjoint Sets, I also implemented and used my own Disjoint Sets class.  This was beneficial as it allowed me to add the methods:
getElements(int setNumber) which returns all the elements for a given set
printElements(int setNum) which prints all the elements for a given set
These methods made it much easier to debug as I could see exactly what was in each set at any time during the algorithm's execution.

Conclusion:
This assignment was very interesting and I feel it was highly beneficial.  Not only did I have to correctly implement my own Disjoint Sets data structure, but I also had to properly alter the Kruskal Algorithm to get my desired result.  I found this project not only satisfying in terms of learning new things, but also because it combined not only my knowledge for data structures, but also what I've learned from my algorithm design classes.  

Finally, I hadn't really ever used JFrame before working on this project, so this was a very informative project in terms of learning how to work with graphics. My maze is capable of not only scaling in physical size (i.e. how many walls it is tall and wide) but also in graphical size (i.e. how many pixels each edge is long).
